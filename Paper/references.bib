  abstract = 	 {Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and has been studied extensively in terms of distance functions and grouping algorithms. Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.}

These, however, are mostly implicitly learned as part of a classification task. In this paper we propose the triplet network model, which aims to learn useful representations by distance comparisons. A similar model was defined by Wang et al. (2014), tailor made for learning a ranking for image information retrieval. Here we demonstrate using various datasets that our model learns a better representation than that of its immediate competitor, the Siamese network. We also discuss future possible usage as a framework for unsupervised learning.},

@article{Zhai2018,
abstract = {The recent research for person re-identification has been focused on two trends. One is learning the part-based local features to form more informative feature descriptors. The other is designing effective metric learning loss functions such as the triplet loss family. We argue that learning global features with classification loss could achieve the same goal, even with some simple and cost-effective architecture design. In this paper, we first explain why the person re-id framework with standard classification loss usually has inferior performance compared to metric learning. Based on that, we further propose a person re-id framework featured by channel grouping and multi-branch strategy, which divides global features into multiple channel groups and learns the discriminative channel group features by multi-branch classification layers. The extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms prior state-of-the-arts in terms of both accuracy and inference speed.},

abstract = {Learning a measure of similarity between pairs of objects is an important generic problem in machine learning. It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35{\%} of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image. This suggests that query independent similarity could be accurately learned even for large scale data sets that could not be handled before.},

abstract = {Leveraging external knowledge to enhance conversational models has become a popular research area in recent years. Compared to vanilla generative models, the knowledge-grounded models may produce more informative and engaging responses. Although various approaches have been proposed in the past, how to effectively incorporate knowledge remains an open research question. It is unclear how much external knowledge should be retrieved and what is the optimal way to enhance the conversational model, trading off between relevant information and noise. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by first extensively evaluating various types of state-of-the-art knowledge-grounded conversational models, including recurrent neural network based, memory networks based, and Transformer based models. We demonstrate empirically that those conversational models can only be enhanced with the right amount of external knowledge. To effectively leverage information originated from external knowledge, we propose a novel Transformer with Expanded Decoder (Transformer-ED or TED for short), which can automatically tune the weights for different sources of evidence when generating responses. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both quality and diversity.},

abstract = {Today's conversational agents often generate responses that not sufficiently informative. One way of making them more informative is through the use of of external knowledge sources with so-called Knowledge-Grounded Conversations (KGCs). In this paper, we target the Knowledge Selection (KS) task, a key ingredient in KGC, that is aimed at selecting the appropriate knowledge to be used in the next response. Existing approaches to Knowledge Selection (KS) based on learned representations of the conversation context, that is previous conversation turns, and use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to optimize KS. Such approaches have two main limitations. First, they do not explicitly track what knowledge has been used in the conversation nor how topics have shifted during the conversation. Second, MLE often relies on a limited set of example conversations for training, from which it is hard to infer that facts retrieved from the knowledge source can be re-used in multiple conversation contexts, and vice versa.We propose Dual Knowledge Interaction Network (DukeNet), a framework to address these challenges. DukeNet explicitly models knowledge tracking and knowledge shifting as dual tasks. We also design Dual Knowledge Interaction Learning (DukeL), an unsupervised learning scheme to train DukeNet by facilitating interactions between knowledge tracking and knowledge shifting, which, in turn, enables DukeNet to explore extra knowledge besides the knowledge encountered in the training set. This dual process also allows us to define rewards that help us to optimize both knowledge tracking and knowledge shifting. Experimental results on two public KGC benchmarks show that DukeNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations, indicating that DukeNet enhanced by DukeL can select more appropriate knowledge and hence generate more informative and engaging responses.},

A majority of the previous works on multi-modal summarization focus on text and images. In this paper, we propose a novel extractive multi-objective optimization based model to produce a multi-modal summary containing text, images, and videos. Important objectives such as intra-modality salience, cross-modal redundancy and cross-modal similarity are optimized simultaneously in a multi-objective optimization framework to produce effective multi-modal output. The proposed model has been evaluated separately for different modalities, and has been found to perform better than state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Cross-modal retrieval takes one type of data as the query to retrieve relevant data of another type. Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches were proposed to learn a common subspace in a joint manner, where the data from all modalities have to be involved during the whole training process. For these approaches, the optimal parameters of different modality-specific transformations are dependent on each other and the whole model has to be retrained when handling samples from new modalities. In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal retrieval method, called Scalable Deep Multimodal Learning (SDML). It proposes to predefine a common subspace, in which the between-class variation is maximized while the within-class variation is minimized. Then, it trains m modality-specific networks for m modalities (one network for each modality) to transform the multimodal data into the predefined common subspace to achieve multimodal learning. Unlike many of the existing methods, our method can train different modality-specific networks independently and thus be scalable to the number of modalities. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed SDML could be one of the first works to independently project data of an unfixed number of modalities into a predefined common subspace. Comprehensive experimental results on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multimodal learning and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in cross-modal retrieval.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
